## Getting Started
### Step 1
Run `npm install` or `yarn install` in the *marko-js-samples* directory.

> This will install all the required parent-level dependencies for the project.

### Step 2
Navigate to the example you would like to try and run: `npm install` or `yarn install` to install all the required modules for that example.
```console
foo@bar:$ cd examples/color-picker
foo@bar:$ npm install
```

### Step 3
NPM Scripts
- `dev`: Serve a the marko application using [marko-serve](https://github.com/marko-js/cli/blob/master/packages/serve/README.md) for local development.
- `build`: Runs babel on the src folder for every package (runs on publish)
- `start`: Runs the `node` command to serve the application from _./build/_ directory.
